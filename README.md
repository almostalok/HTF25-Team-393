# Saarthi - civic reporting platform (MVP)

This repository contains the SAARTHI MVP with two main folders: `client/` (Next.js) and `server/` (Express + Mongoose).

Phase A scaffolding added: server skeleton, models (Issue, User), and a placeholder `/api/report` endpoint.

See server README and usage below.
